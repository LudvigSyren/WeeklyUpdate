\begin{enumerate}
    \item Kept on working with the model, that would introduce the stiffness matrix
    from ABB in AGX Dynamics.
    \item Read and learned about orientation representation and modelling of constraint.
    \item Finalized a model that is to be presented to the supervisors. The model is
    is explained in section \ref{Papers} but there is still som flaws regarding understanding of the
    angles representing oreientation.
